	<section> <p> It's finally starting to feel like spring and I'm starting to think about what I want to do this summer.  One of the things I love to do is take art courses whenever possible.  This summer I would love to go to Toronto and take a course at the <abbr title="Art Gallery of Ontario">AGO</abbr> and to check out all of the amazing exhibits there. I was super excited to learn that <abbr title="Art Gallery of Ontario">AGO</abbr> does have <a href="https://ago.ca/learn/courses/children-youth" title="AGO Courses for Kids"> courses for Children and Youth </a>. One of the special exhbits that I would love to see is the <a href="https://ago.ca/exhibitions/kaws-family" title="KWAS exhibit">KAWS: Family exhibit </a>. </p> </section>

	<section> <p> Happy first day of spring!!! <br> 
I wanted to take this opportunity to welcome a new and budding artist during this Spring Equinox.  Her name is <b>Mia</b>.  We met at a local art exhibition and I love all of her art pieces. </p> </section> <br>

 <section> <p> It's a <abbr title="New Year">NY</abbr>, and I thought it would be a nice reflective exercise to make a little table on the type of art that I created in 2023. Maybe it will influence me to try some new things. Or maybe I will just keep doing more of the same.  Just feel like it's necessary to make some kind of table.  </p>  <br> <br>
